🚀 CO2 Emission Analysis with Tableau & Python

📌 Project Overview
Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges of our time, and understanding CO2 emissions is crucial in driving actionable solutions. This project leverages Python and Tableau to analyze CO2 emissions across different countries and industries, uncovering key insights into environmental impact trends.

Through data-driven storytelling, we visualize emission patterns, highlight significant contributors, and provide meaningful insights for policy-makers and environmentalists.

🎯 Key Objectives
✔️ Analyze CO2 emissions data to identify trends and major contributors.
✔️ Utilize Python for data preprocessing to clean, transform, and optimize datasets.
✔️ Develop interactive Tableau dashboards to present findings effectively.
✔️ Provide data-driven insights that support sustainable decision-making.
